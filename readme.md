hi! i post blockate scripts here! and no i prob wont post a blockate script that eats a whole world or anything bad. so uhh hopefully these are fine? as they do not access any information that they don't have already and you MUST have admin on a world for the Anti-Grief script. With exclusion of the age detection.

The anti-grief is forked from choke's resp with addded features

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU GET BANNED. (Even though you shouldn't because its quite ethical and blockate really needs to make their own solution)

add me on dc for any suggestions:
